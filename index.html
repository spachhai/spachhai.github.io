                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Utah. 
                        My research focuses on the quantitative study of Earth structure and dynamic processes using geophysical observations 
                        and the development of computational and statistical methods including machine learning algorithm to elucidate Earth structure with rigorous uncertainties. 
                        It is challenging to compute waveforms for realistic three-dimensional Earth structure that includes small-scale structures in the deep Earth interior
                        due to the computational cost it demands. Some of the machine learning algorithms may help in addressing this challenge.</p>
                    <p class="subheading mb-5"> Research Statement </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                        The analysis of seismological observations (e.g., seismic waves, Earth normal modes – the vibrational pattern due to 
                        large earthquakes, Movie 1) is a key component to inferring the structure and dynamic processes of the Earth. My research interests 
                        include the quantitative study of Earth structure and dynamic processes by inversion of seismological observations and the 
                        development of computational methods to elucidate Earth structure. My past and current studies focus on developement and implementation of 
                        probabilistic (Bayesian) hierarchical inversion to achieve better understanding of the structure, composition, and dynamics of the solid 
                        Earth interior. While increased data quality, new inference techniques, and increased computational power have improved our 
                        understanding of the Earth’s interior, the interpretation of inversion results remains challenging because of inherent 
                        nonuniqueness (many models explain the data equally well) and nonlinearities. I assert that rigorous model parameter estimates 
                        and uncertainties are required for meaningful physical interpretation. In Bayesian inversion, parameters are considered as 
                        random variables and their values are represented by probability densities that express degrees of belief. Parameters are 
                        assigned prior information which is independent of the data and updated by data information to produce the inversion result 
                        (posterior probability density) from which rigorous parameter values and uncertainties can be inferred. In addition to Earth structure, 
                        we can treat noise in the data as unknown and infer them applying hierarchical Bayesian approach.</p>

                        Core-reflected waves (i.e., PcP and ScP, Figure 1) have been extensively utilized to constrain small-scale structures that exhibit a 
                        strong decrease in shear (S)- and compressional (P)- wave velocity above the CMB, known as Ultra Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs). 
                        However, the details of extent and fine structure are poorly understood because of the nonuniqueness (Figure 2) and nonlinearity of the 
                        inverse problem. Therefore, I developed a novel Bayesian approach to constrain ULVZ parameter values and uncertainties. 
                        I applied this method to ScP waves recorded by the Hi-Net array (Japan) that sample the CMB beneath the east of Philippines. 
                        This study found a complex ULVZ with dense material sitting at the bottom of two layers. An extension of this study 
                        generalizes the inversion to consider an unknown model parameterization (i.e. the number of layers and data noise are 
                        unknown — a trans-dimensional model). Additionally, the noise in the data also treated as uknown extending the method to hierarchical 
                        trans-dimensional Bayesian inversion. The new study produces more general, but consistent, results than our previous 
                        work and, in particular, more meaningful uncertainties which improves comparisons between data sets. Recently, I also 
                        applied the trans-dimensional (trans-D) approach to additional waveforms recorded by the Australian transportable array 
                        WOMBAT to study an extensive CMB area beneath the east of Australia.</p>

                        Another project improves the measurement of splitting functions (a visualization of the radial average of the normal-mode 
                        sensed structure, Figure 3) for inner core sensitive modes, which are relatively well isolated in frequency, by inversion of normal 
                        mode spectra (Figure 3). Splitting functions depend linearly on isotropic and anisotropic velocities in the Earth. Inner core structure 
                        has been extensively studied using normal modes and body waves but is still controversial because of strong non-linearity. 
                        Therefore, my project applies nonlinear optimization (neighborhood algorithm — NA) to compute the splitting functions of the 
                        13S2 (spheroidal mode with radial order 13 and angular order 2) mode. For the observed data, the splitting functions of this 
                        mode are dominated by zonal structure with positive frequency anomalies near the poles and negative frequency anomalies along 
                        the equator. One of the main benefits of the NA approach is that the splitting functions of this mode can be constrained with 
                        significantly fewer events in comparison to those using traditional approaches. Limitations of the NA approach are under sampling 
                        for higher orders (billions of samples are required) and lack of rigorous uncertainty estimation. To address the limitations, 
                        I have adapted the Bayesian ULVZ inversion to this problem and successfully applied for 19 inner-core sensitive modes. I am 
                        currently working on the application of this approach to the mantle sensitive modes.</p>

                            <p class="lead mb-5">I am continuously searching for ULVZ using ScP waveforms (shown in the previous section) sampling different locations of the core-mantle boundary. 
                                I am also interested in applying multi-disciplinary approach to understand the physical origin of ULVZs. For such a study, we recently applied geodynamical 
                                modeling of ULVZs we observed beneath the Coral Sea  <span>&#8212;</span> east of Australia. In this study, we found that ULVZs are thin on two sides 
                                and occur at the edge of the Pacific large low-shear-velocity province. Our geodynamic modelling shows that ULVZs are compositional heterogeneous within them 
                                that may be caused by the remnants of Earth’s early differentiation. These structures are compositionally distinct from their surroundings and reside at the bottom of 
                                the mantle without full homogenization throughout Earth’s history. 
                                <br></br>
                                This processes is summarized in Figure 1. In the initial molten stage of the magma ocean, 
                                dense materials sink downward due to gravitational instabilities15. The magma ocean starts to crystallize from the middle (Fig. 1A) and crystalizes faster 
                                towards the surface and slower towards the CMB due to different heat flux near the surface and the CMB (Fig. 1B). As the magma ocean crystalizes, 
                                melt is increasingly iron enriched, which in turn increases intrinsic density. As a result, a layer of intrinsically dense materials remains after 
                                the crystallization of the basal magma ocean, and the intrinsic density of this layer increases with depth (Fig. 1b). The global layer of intrinsically 
                                dense ULVZ materials on the CMB are later pushed by mantle flow into isolated ULVZ patches with variable and significant topography near the edges of 
                                large-low shear velocity provinces (Fig. 1c-d), and the depth-dependence of the intrinsic density anomaly of the ULVZs persist until the present.

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> The geodynamic modeling results are shown in movies below. Movie 1 (left column) shows a time series of the temperature field (bottom row), 
                                the residual buoyancy field (buoyancy field with the horizontal average removed; top row), and the chemical field (middle row). The ULVZ patches at the edges of the thermochemical 
                                pile have triangular shapes, and they are thicker in the middle and thinner at both flanks. In the middle of the ULVZ patches, the magnitude of the negative 
                                residual buoyancy increases with depth, while the residual buoyancy becomes more homogeneous towards the 
                                margins of the ULVZ patches. The increase of the density anomaly (or the magnitude of negative residual buoyancy) of the ULVZ patches 
                                with depth is more prominent during the early stages of the calculation, and this phenomenon gradually becomes weaker due to mixing. 
                                However, the density anomaly remains increasing with depth after 4.5 Gyr. Notably, the features of ULVZ patches in this geodynamic model are 
                                consistent with the observed ULVZs where density increases with depth and thickness decreases farther into the LLSVPs. The density increase, combined 
                                with the temperature increase as a function of ULVZ depth can explain the decrease of S-wave velocity with depth. Our modeling also explains the 
                                spatial variations of density and velocity within the ULVZs as well as a rapid spatial change of ULVZ thickness (Figure 1 above). To study this result further, 
                                two more experiments are performed, in which the initial density anomaly of the dense layer increases from 1.5% to 10% (case 2, middle column), and from 1.5% to 5% 
                                (case 3, right column) at the CMB. These results show that the density anomaly within the ULVZ patches homogenizes faster for lower initial density contrasts of the dense layer. 
                                In addition, a ULVZ with lower initial density material mixes faster into LLSVP materials

                                processes in the lowermost mantle, and their link to large-scale mantle structures. However, most of the core-mantle boundary region remains unexamined in terms

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> Here, we estimate waveform complexity by measuring the sample entropy of the time series at different decimating factors (defined as scale). 
                                For a fixed scale, waveforms with higher complexity produce a higher value of entropy, while signals with a higher degree of regularity (i.e. lower complexity) 
                                yield lower values of entropy. This approach has been applied in biological sciences to discriminate between states of health in individuals

                                We have no knowledge of whether the remaining 83% of CMB area has ULVZs. To cover wider area of the core-mantle boundary, we considered a global dataset of SPdKS waveforms 
                                and analyzed a subset of these data in the distance range from 106 to 115 degree distance in search of highly anomalous SPdKS waveforms. Here we apply the Bayesian

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> Normal-mode structure coefficients are crucial observations to infer the velocity, density
                                and attenuation structure of the deep Earth interior, but estimating these coefficients from
                                Earth’s normal mode spectra is a non-linear inverse problem. Additionally, complete source
                                information is typically unknown for large earthquakes, and there is a trade-off between
                                the earthquake source and attenuation. Therefore, proper estimation of elastic and anelastic
                                structure coefficients with their uncertainties becomes challenging. Here, we combine amatrix
                                autoregression and a fully non-linear hierarchical Bayesian approach to address existing limitations.
                                The hierarchical approach additionally quantifies the noise in the data.
                                We applied this approach to the inner-core sensitive spheroidal (S) modes measured for earthquakes
                                from 1994 to 2016. We further implement a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether
                                anelastic structure can be estimated reliably well. Our model selection criterion indicates that anelastic structure
                                coefficients are required only for modes with strong shear-wave energy in the inner core.
                                Inversion results also show a strong correlation between elastic and anelastic splitting functions
                                for thesemodes. This indicates that the seismic waves travel faster and strongly attenuate along
                                polar paths such that the m = 0 singlet remains poorly observed for these modes. The estimation of elastic/anelastic structure 
                                for mantle sensitive modes is also equally important, and I am currently working on this.

                            <p class="lead mb-5">The detailed-crustal velocity structure beneath Nepal Himalayas allows us to better understand the tectonic processes and 
                                improve the earthquake location and seismic hazard evaluation for the region. Previous studies suggest an anisotropic Main-Himalayan Thrust 
                                (MHT) beneath Nepal based on conversions of direct P-waves coming from different backazimuths and distant earthquakes (teleseismic receiver 
                                functions). However, proper quantification of isotropic/anisotropic velocity and dipping of MHT and their uncertainties become challenging 
                                due to the trade-off between layer properties. Additionally, there are limited studies on the extensive-crustal structures beneath Nepal. 
                                We recently developed a hierarchical Bayesian inversion of both radial and transverse receiver functions and here applied it to data from narrow backazimuth 
                                and epicentral distance ranges recorded on more than 30 temporary seismic stations in Nepal. The inversion results for the stations near the 
                                southern edge of the Himalayan front (main-frontal thrust) show a strong anisotropic layer ( 35±5%) with high dip ( 20±5°) between a very 
                                slow-velocity shallow layer above and a fast-velocity deeper layer below it. The anisotropic layer continues northward with low dip angles (5±2°) 
                                beneath the stations south of Kathmandu and high dip angles north of Kathmandu. This anisotropic layer may be due to the shearing motion between 
                                the northward moving Indian crust with respect to the overriding Himalayan crust. Our inversion further suggests a very high S-wave velocity and 
                                strong anisotropy in the top layer, particularly north of the thrust that separates high Himalaya from lesser Himalaya (main-central thrust). 
                                Here, we further focus on the inversion of receiver functions from different backazimuths and short-period surface-wave dispersions extracted 
                                from the noise. The surface wave dispersions remove the depth-velocity trade-offs and give strong constraints on the average S-wave velocity 
                                while the receiver functions from multiple backazimuths enable to better estimate the anisotropy. <br> 
                            The S-wave velocity model beneath Himalaya Nepal is shown in Figure 1. I am currently working on the joint inversion of S-wave velocity and receiver functions.</p>

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> In the first predictive modeling project, I used personal loan data that have Age, Experince, Income, ZipCode, Family, Average Spending,
                                Education, Mortgage, Securities Account, and certificate of deposit as independent variables and Loan (whether approved or not approved) as independent variable.

                                After reading the data file, I first removed the education column as I do not think that the education significantly matters for the loan approval.
                                Then I developed a workflow for Decision Tree model using 70/30 partition rule for training and test. I also Loan as target variable from the rest of the variables. 
                                I further developed a workflow for Random Forest (classification) model using Loan as target variable. Finally, I compared the results from these two different methods.
                                I found that both models perform well with greater than 88% of AUC values and greater than 94% of overall accuracy. But for comparison point of view, 
                                I would choose Random Forest for the following reasons. Overall accuracies are almost identical for both models, however, the AUC value is higher for 
                                random forest and the ROC curve for Random Forest is also above than that for Decision Tree (Figure below). Therefore, I pick the Random Forest model among these two models.

                            <p class="lead mb-5">his project focused on the prediction of car price. The data had Age, KM, Fuel_Type, HP, Met_color, Automatic, Cylinder Volume, Doors, Quarterly Tax and Weight 
                                as independent variables, and Price as dependent variables. As Cylinder Volume and Quarterly Tax do not sifnificantly contribute on the price, I excluded these
                                two variables from the data. Then I did a significant test using linear regression for the rest of the variables. From this significant test, I found that 
                                only Age, KM, Fuel_Type=Petrol, HP, weight were significant with p-value less than 0.05. I developed the workflow for linear regression model with 70/30 partition 
                                for training and test data with Price as target variable. I also developed the linear regression model with 10-fold cross validation. Then I compared the R2 and RMSE 
                                values from both linear regression with and without cross validation. I found that both model performs equally well with 85% R2 value, but the RMSE value for 
                                linear regression is lower than that for linear regression with cross validation. Therefore, I choose the linear regression model over cross validation.</p>

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> In this project I worked for the prediction of housing price using linear regression. This data had Nbhd (neighborhood), Offers, SQFT, Brick, Bedrooms, and Bathrooms
                                as independent variables and Price as dependent variable. I first created dummy variables for Nbhd variables as 1, 2, 3, and 4 for three direction does not really mean anything here.
                                Then I applied column filter to remove ID and Nbhd features, as ID does not mean anything for the modeling and Nbhd is already converted to other dummy variables. Then I applied linear 
                                regression using Price as target variable with 70/30 partitioning of the data as training and test. I also applied random forest linear regression approach. I found 83% and 77% R2 value for
                                linear regression without and with random forest, respectively suggesting that linear regression without random forest performs better. Additionally, the RMSE value for linear regresion 
                                model is lower than that for linear regression with random forest, which further supports for a better performance of linear regression without random forest. One of the reasons is that 
                                there are only 128 data poins. To perform reliable random forest calculation we need more data points.

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> This project analyzes the data collected as part of the telemarketing calls by a Portuguese retail bank with the aim of getting long-term deposits so that bank’s 
                                financial assets can be increased by enhancing the business. The target variable for this data was whether the campaign call was successful or not. Features from the phone call were 
                                combined with the data from central bank of Portuguese Republic statistical web site. After combining all the data, there were 150 features in total. The data have been previously 
                                preprocessed and contain no errors. After careful selection features, this dataset has only 20 features. As these data were already processed, I will focus on the statistical analysis 
                                and modeling. Here, I apply three methods (logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network) and compare results in terms of their predictability. After careful consideration of 
                                feature selection and balancing the data, all the models perform well in predicting outcome for both trained and test data. The comparative analysis of both confusion matrix and ROC curve 
                                indicates that neural network performs the best among all the methods.</p>
                                <p></p>
                            <p class="lead mb-5">The dataset I am using in this project was downloaded from the University of California Irvine (UCI) website. The data were collected for 5 years from 2008 to 2013. 
                                To collect these data, customers were contacted by bank agents via fixed line or mobile. Alternatively, if the client calls the bank for any other reasons, he/she was asked to subscribe 
                                the deposit. This dataset has 20 features and 41188 records. These data include four classes of telemarketing features: (1) bank client data with 7 features (age, job, marital, 
                                education, default, housing, and loan), (2) contact related data with 4 features (contact, month, day_of_week, duration), (3) social and economic context with 5 features 
                                (emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, nr.employed), and (4) others with 4 features (campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome). More detailed explanation of 
                                these features can be found on both Jupyter notebook and UCI website. As this is a classification problem, the target variable (y) for this problem has two options: 
                                whether a client subscribes term deposit (yes or no). Figure 1 shows the bar and pie chart plots for the target variable and illustrates that only ~11% of the calls 
                                were subscribed for the deposit indicating highly unbalanced data. Therefore, any prediction made from this data can be biased towards unsuccessful outcome. I checked 
                                through all the data and found no errors in the data (both features and responses). But there are missing values reported as unknowns. I replaced missing values by mean 
                                and mode for numerical variables and string variables, respectively. I also found outliers except in the case of four features (emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, euribor3m, 
                                and nr.employed). I replaced outliers by the threshold values. See Section 4 in notebook in github for more details. </p>

                                <p class="lead mb-5"> In this project, I applied three classification methods (logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network) with and without careful 
                                    processing of data. Logistic regression models the probability of a discrete outcome from the given features. Here, I applied the most common logistic regression
                                     that gives binary outcomes (“yes” or “no”). In contrast, decision tree creates branching structures with a set of rules to distinguish values in a hierarchical form. 
                                     This maybe the simplest approach to understanding, but there is a high chance of overfitting if we do not tune the hyperparameters. I then applied multilayer perceptron 
                                     neural network with one hidden layer. Neural network with no hidden layers represents the logistic regression. The neural networks are good for learning complex 
                                     nonlinear problems, particularly for problems with large number of features. <br> 
                                     To estimate the model performance for all these models, I computed confusion matrix with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also computed Receiver Operating 
                                     Characteristics (ROC) curves and area under curve (AUC) values. These metrics tell us how correct and precise model predictions are by comparing it against true evaluations. 
                                     For more details, I refer to the Jupyter notebook (Section 6.1.2). </p>

                            <p class="lead mb-5"> I explored the data using descriptive and exploratory data analysis (see Section 2-4 in notebook). As mentioned in the data, duration is an 
                                         important variable as it is directly linked to the outcome. If the call duration is 0, the assumption is that the client does not sign up for bank deposit. 
                                         As a result, duration has a large uncertainty (challenging to trust) with longest call being 4918 s (~80 minutes). Additionally, box plot indicates that there 
                                         are many outliers for duration resulting a wider uncertainty.  I also find that in average ~10 minutes (553 sec) long call was enough for successful campaign, 
                                         but it still has high uncertainty, probably due to outliers. Similarly, in average 2 calls were enough for a successful campaign. <br>

                                <p class="lead mb-5"> Similarly, standard deviation for age indicates that the campaign was intended to a wider age group (17 to 98 years). The average age of all the subscribed clients 
                                         is ~40 years while the average age of subscribed unmarried clients was 31 years. Additionally, the age between 31 to 50 were most likely to subscribe for the deposit. 
                                         The multivariate analysis indicates that the longest call was made to a 33-year old unmarried technician and has proessional.course degree. Number of days past from 
                                         the last contact (pdays) has very high mean value and uncertainty indicating that most clients were not contacted before as that value was set to 999 for those with 
                                         no contacts before. Comparatively, there are many customers who work as admin, are married, have university degree, have no default, have housing, have no loans, 
                                         and were contacted on cellular phone during the month of May. The Consumer price index (cons.price.idx) has very low uncertainty indicating very consistent index 
                                         between the clients selected. Maybe that was one of the criteria on the selection of clients for calls. The histograms for categorical variables indicate that 
                                         most of the clients (~25%) work as admin. Similarly, ~60% of the people are married, ~30% have university degree, ~80% have no loan default, ~52% have housing, 
                                         ~82% do not have loan, mostly contacted (33%) during the month of May. The heatmap shows that only duration, previous, emp.var.rate, euribor3m, and nr.employed 
                                         have either positive or negative correlations with the outcome. There are also strong positive correlation between different dependent variables, for example, 
                                         between euribor3m and emp.var.rate, nr.employed and emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx and emp.var.rate, and nr.employed and euribor3m (See Section 3). 
                                         This indicates that not all the features are important for the modeling.<br>
                                         I divided data into train (80%) and test (20%) set and applied three methods with the aim of increasing accuracy, recall, precision and F1 scores as 
                                         the goal here is to reduce false positive and false negative. When all the features are considered in the modeling, the performance is very poor 
                                         (top panels of Figure 2a-b and Figure 3) in that true positive are too low in compared to true negatives. Then the data were balanced using various 
                                         algorithms (undersampling of majority class, upsampling of minority class, and SMOTE sampling). In this case True positives are also high for train data, 
                                         but true positives are still low for the test data (Figure 2c-d). To address this problem and improve the model performance for both train and test data, 
                                         I converted education and months into numerical values and removed day_of_week, loan, and housing features as I did not find much effect of those variables 
                                         in the outcome. I also applied label encoding for the remaining categorical variables so that the number of features remains the same followed by upsampling 
                                         of minority class to balance the data. Then the same algorithms were applied. In this case, both true positives and true negatives are high in both train and 
                                         test data (Figure 2e-f). Additionally, all the scores (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1) improved significantly and are similar for both test and train data (Table 1).</p>

                                    parallel computing to achieve the faster convergence of the algorithm. For more details, I refer to Manu-marfo et al. (2019) and Mohammadi et al. (2022)</li>
